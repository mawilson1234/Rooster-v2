<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:

research, Brian Dillon, of the University of Massachusetts
Amherst, is investigating the processes involved in the comprehension of
English sentences. The information collected in this study will be used in the preparation
of papers for presentation in international conferences and journals on
language. You are eligible to participate in this study because you are a
native speaker of English, over 18 years of age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>Procedures<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'>In this study, you will first be asked a few questions about your language background, and then you will be asked to read English sentences. You may read sentences in a word by word fashion, or all at once. After you read the sentences, you will be asked questions about the sentences, such as how natural they seem, or what you take to be the most likely meaning of the sentences. The entire process should take about 45 minutes. In compensation, you will be given credit through the Linguistics Department's SONA system. You will be awarded 1 credit if the duration of your participation is 30 minutes or less; the reward for 31&ndash;60 minutes of partipation would be 2 credits.</p>
